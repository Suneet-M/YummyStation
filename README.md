# YummyStation
This is a project built using AngularJs and Yeoman.\
It is inspired by the Udacity Meals App, and I made this as practise after learning AngularJs in Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree course.\
In the course itself they showed us snippets of this app, then I decided to build it myself with their data.\
This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.16.0.

## Attribution
All the JSON files in the data folder have been gathered from Udacity's App [repo](https://github.com/udacity/FEF-UdaciMeals-Angular), and I take no credit for it.

## Build & development
Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing
Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
